## Summary

The average overall recall score for the six models was 70%. Based on overall accuracy and in considering this is an analysis of risk. It would be better to choose models with high risk scores and models tha shows the most accuracy, in this case those woul be Balanced Random Forest Classifier and the Easy Ensemble Classifier.
